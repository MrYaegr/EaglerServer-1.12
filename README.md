To make an eaglercraft 1.12 server, follow the instructions below:
Here is how you can setup a connection:

First, go to the top of the repo and click on code > codespaces > create codespace
now you have your own free server instance to host eaglercraft. Next you need to run the setup commands:

Create a terminal tab and paste the following:
<br>
<br>
First:
<br>
cd /workspaces/EaglerServer-1.12/bungee
<br>
java -jar bungee.jar
<br>
<br>
Next, open a new terminal window and enter the following:
<br>
<br>
cd /workspaces/EaglerServer-1.12/server
<br>
java -Xms512m -Xmx2G -jar server.jar nogui
<br>

Now go to the ports area and forward (and make public) port 8081
Load up the client! When you are in, copy the link, paste it in the add server section, replace https:// with wss:// and join! Your eaglercraft server is setup!

PS: You can use this as a normal server too (like properly hosted) just clone this repo and run it in much the same way.
